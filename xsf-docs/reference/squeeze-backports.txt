Backports for squeeze
=====================
Cyril Brulebois <kibi@debian.org>


Bird’s-eye view
---------------

If one forgets about libraries and clients, a whole X stack boils down
to: the server itself, input and video drivers, libdrm, and mesa.

To keep things simple, the idea is to backport all of those to
`squeeze` through `squeeze-backports`, along with some of the
additional packages which might be involved (like `libxfont` or
`x11proto-fixes-dev`).

The backports were prepared so that it’s possible to upgrade the
`input-all` and `video-all` meta packages on `amd64` and `i386`. If
specific drivers (maintained by the X Strike Force) are wanted,
requesting them on the `debian-backports@` / `debian-x@` mailing lists
should do the trick. For other drivers, please contact the relevant
package maintainers.


Instructions
------------

The usual link:http://backports-master.debian.org/[backports instructions]
apply. But let’s gather everything in a single place.

Add that to your `sources.list`:
----
deb http://backports.debian.org/debian-backports squeeze-backports main
----

Update your cache:
----
apt-get update
----

If you’re interested in just upgrading the usual `mesa` packages:
----
apt-get install -t squeeze-backports libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx
----

If you want the whole stack, we should distinguish between two
cases.

In the usual case, both the `xserver-xorg-input-all` and
`xserver-xorg-video-all` meta packages were installed, and pulled a
lot of packages, which should work for most users.
Specifying a few packages to upgrade should pull
everything from `squeeze-backports`.

----
apt-get install -t squeeze-backports xorg xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-input-all xserver-xorg-video-all
apt-get install -t squeeze-backports libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx
----

In case only the needed packages were installed, like the `synaptics`
input driver and the `intel` video driver, the following should be
sufficient:
----
apt-get install -t squeeze-backports xorg xserver-xorg xserver-xorg-core xserver-xorg-input-synaptics xserver-xorg-video-intel
apt-get install -t squeeze-backports libgl1-mesa-dri libgl1-mesa-glx
----

It is probably a very good idea to install the Linux kernel from
`squeeze-backports` as well. It is even required for the `nouveau`
video driver.
