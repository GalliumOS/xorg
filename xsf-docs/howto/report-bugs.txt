How to report bugs
==================

Report it upstream
------------------

In most cases, it is preferrable to report the bug upstream at
https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=xorg

See https://01.org/linuxgraphics/documentation/how-report-bugs-0 for a good
introduction on how to write useful bug reports. While the document is targeted
at Intel graphics hardware, it is a good guideline for other vendor’s hardware
as well.

Simple as reportbug
-------------------

Initial report
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unless you know which package to report the bug against, you can
report the bug against the `xorg` metapackage:

----
reportbug xorg
----

Like most packages related to the X server, reporting a bug against
this package triggers a bug script which is going to collect X-related
information, be it installed packages, running kernel, X
configuration, X log, and so on.

****
.Note
In case this metapackage wasn’t used to install your X stack,
report a bug against `xserver-xorg` instead. And if that one isn’t
installed either, go for `xserver-xorg-core`.
****

If a backtrace shows up in the X log, it’s much appreciated to try and
get a link:use-gdb.html[full backtrace using gdb].


Follow-up with more info
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you reported a bug against another package and if that bug was
reassigned to an X-related package, we might need more
information. You can run the bug script manually and attach its output
to your mail to the bug report:

----
/usr/share/bug/xserver-xorg-core/script 3>/tmp/script.log
----

****
.Note
Make sure there’s no space between `3` and `>`, that’s a shell
redirection.
