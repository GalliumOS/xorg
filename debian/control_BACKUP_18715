Package: x11-common
Architecture: all

Depends: ${misc:Depends}, lsb-base (>= 1.3-9ubuntu2)
Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not
 provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities
 required to run the X Window System.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: X.Org X Window System
 This metapackage provides the components for a standalone
 workstation running the X Window System.  It provides the X libraries, an X
 server, a set of fonts, and a group of basic X clients and utilities.
 .
 Higher level metapackages, such as those for desktop environments, can
 depend on this package and simplify their dependencies.
 .
 It should be noted that a package providing x-window-manager should also
 be installed to ensure a comfortable X experience.

Description: miscellaneous X clients - metapackage
 An X client is a program that interfaces with an X server (almost always via
 the X libraries), and thus with some input and output hardware like a
 graphics card, monitor, keyboard, and pointing device (such as a mouse).
 .
 This package provides a miscellaneous assortment of several dozen X clients
 that ship with the X Window System.
 .
 This package is provided for transition from earlier Debian releases, the
 programs formerly in xutils and xbase-clients having been split out in smaller
 packages.

 programs formerly in xutils and xbase-clients having been split out in smaller
 packages.
