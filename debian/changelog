  * Merge xsf-docs up to the 8fc70f1e37 commit:
    - Add: howtos/build-mesa
    - Add: reference/upstream-contacts
    - Update: howtos/report-bugs
  * rules: Get rid of DEFAULT_DCRESOLUTIONS, unused since 2009.
  * Fix /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config handling:
    - Don't forget to copy the new configuration file if there was none
      previously. Thanks to Kyle Dassoff (Closes: #612979).
  * As a consequence of this bug, users having installed x11-common using
    version 1:7.6+1 or 1:7.6+2 want to run “dpkg-reconfigure x11-common”
    to generate the Xwrapper.config file.
  * Use “tempfile -m 644” to generate the temporary file which gets copied
    back into place. There's no secret in there (Closes: #581338).
  * 50x11-common_determine-startup: Take $SHELL into account, defaulting
    to sh if SHELL is unset or null (Closes: #604010).
  * Fix FTBFS on sparc{,64} by working around wkhtmltopdf's #613141:
    remove the SVG file from the CSS on these architectures.

xorg (1:7.6+2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Merge xsf-docs documentation. That's an offline copy of the
    documentation available online (http://pkg-xorg.alioth.debian.org/) in
    the following formats: HTML, PDF, and TXT.
  * Call make/make clean in xsf-docs/ accordingly. Do the “make” part
    under xvfb-run since wkhtmltopdf requires a working display, at least
    at the moment.
  * Ship xsf-docs in the xserver-xorg metapackage, under the following
    directory: /usr/share/doc/xorg
  * Add build-deps accordingly:
    - markdown: .mdwn to .html
    - wkhtmltopdf: .html to .pdf
    - xvfb: wkhtmltopdf needs a display.
    - xauth: xvfb-run needs it.
  * Remove xbase-clients maintainer scripts: Stop caring about
    /etc/X11/app-defaults/Beforelight, which was needed while upgrading
    from versions earlier than 1:7.4+2. Now even squeeze has a newer
    version.
  * Ditto for xutils: Stop caring about /etc/X11/rstart, 1:7.3+11 was a
    long time ago.
  * Tighten the dependency between xorg and xserver-xorg, to prevent from
    being able to upgrade xorg only (e.g. to X11R7.6) while still having
    xserver-xorg and xserver-xorg-core in a lower version (e.g. X11R7.5).
  * Ship a bug control file for xorg, making it report-with: xserver-xorg,
    which gives us the exact version of the server (the bug script isn't
    always sufficient), but also the drivers.
  * Remove obsolete material:
    - dexconf: Good bye!
    - xorg.conf: No real need for an example, with autodetection. If some
      documentation is still needed, it can be added to xsf-docs.

  * x11-common: drop usage of /var/lib/x11/Xwrapper.config.{md5sum,roster}.
    Since sarge (I think), no other package has been handling
    /etc/X11/Xwrapper.config, so assume we're the only owner, remove the state
    files on upgrade.  The checksum is also not needed, we read the
    allowed_users value from the file in the config script and preserve it.

  * Make xserver-xorg-video-nouveau a dependency again.

  * Don't write the default depth to xorg.conf any more.
    The drivers should choose the appropriate depth by default now.
  * Don't bother with resolutions in xorg.conf
    We now rely on the server and drivers to do the right thing. Previously,
    our best-case scenario was to have the xserver-xorg postinstall script ask
    the monitor what the optimal values were, and if that wasn't possible to
    give the user a default list of resolutions and a best-guess hsync and
    vrefresh values that the user could override. The server and almost all
    drivers will do this on boot anyway using properly maintained code, which
    allows them to better adapt to changes. randr 1.2-compliant drivers will
    do this even better than we possibly could. Finally, the server will
    provide a better list of defaults than we were doing anyway. There will
    undoubtedly be bugs uncovered by this change, but we need  to find and fix
    the actual bugs in the drivers and server in order to move forward.

  * Get rid of all the explicit modes by default. They just bloated the

    + The /config/display/modes now has no default (blank). As a result of

      The debconfage and dexconf will not fill in this section at all. The
      server will then choose the highest resolution that it can probe with
      DDC. This should work for most people, who are probably choosing their
      best resolution anyway. If xresprobe is available and used, the
      resolutions it finds will be selected. Until there is a good way for the
      server to store this information by itself, we should leave this as it
      is. Most people can get by without this section, but it'll help some of
      those with broken hardware.
    + If the user does select a mode or modes for this question, dexconf no
      longer iterates through a set of depths and puts the mode list in for
      each. Instead, if dexconf does find a set of specified modes, it will
      write a single "Display" subsection for the screen, and it will contain
      the modes. This is functionally equivalent to what we were doing anyway,

  * Don't write the DRI section to xorg.conf. We now ship a default mode in
    libdrm as of libdrm 2.3.0-3, so we don't need to do this. Users can still
    override the default mode in their xorg.conf's if they choose
  * Don't write the files section of xorg.conf by default. If the user does
    want to write the files section, don't write out any font paths, only
    write out the font server bit if they specify that.
    + This will depend on having xserver-xorg-core version 2:1.3.0.0.dfsg-3
      which includes a patch to always look in the default font paths by

    postinst scripts:
    - introduce a new discover_sparc_video() function which uses prtconf
      rather than discover to do the hardware detection. discover does not
      support detection of devices attached to UPA and SBUS buses, common
      on sparc, so it's pretty useless there.
    - use this function on sparc by introducing the DISCOVER_PROG and
      DISCOVER_FUNC variables, preserving the old behavior for all other
      arches. Adjust the debugging messages appropriately.
    - set the default sparc driver to 'sunffb'.
    - set default keyboard rules for sparc to 'xorg' instead of obsolete
      'sun'. The keyboard layer in 2.6 kernels have been unified across
      all arches, so 'xorg' is the correct setting now.
    - add 'cfb' and 'cfb32' to the list of modules loaded by default on
      sparc, since the symbols provided by them are required by sunffb
      driver. Closes: #352869, #377809
    - set the default color depth to 8 for the 'cgsix' driver, as it's the
      maximum depth supported by it.

  * setuid for /usr/bin/X (stolen from monolith's debian/rules)
  * Provide xlibs and xlibs-data transitional packages. These are empty
    packages that depend on the packages that replace them.
  * Create an xorg metapackage that provides x-window-system(-core). This is a
    simpler name and should suffice. We don't need this split between -system
    and -system-core. If people want twm and so forth they can install it.
    This package installs -core plus xterm currently.
  * Re-add x-window-system-dev package under the new name of xorg-dev. Note to
    packagers: this is not meant to be build-dep'ed on, but is a convenience
    package for users.
  * Provide a compatibility symlink to /usr/lib/X11/fonts (their new home) at
    /usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts. This will let external fonts work as expected.
    Thanks Eugene Konev.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu14) dapper; urgency=low

  * Support preseeding of xserver-xorg/config/display/default_depth even
    when autodetecting video. (Unfortunately, this will mean that people get
    the wrong default presented on second and subsequent low-priority
    reconfigures, though.)

  * Would be nice if we would still exit 0, however...

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu12) dapper; urgency=low

  * Make /etc/init.d/x11-common completely silent unless running VERBOSE.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu11) dapper; urgency=low

  * Fix first-installation logic to cope with being called from the postinst
    too (closes: Malone #29564).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 27 Jan 2006 18:22:46 +0000

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu10) dapper; urgency=low

    Depends field of xserver-xorg-driver-all
  * Remove xserver-xorg-input-wacom from the Depends field of
    xserver-xorg-input-all

    xlibs-static-dev, since the latter no longer exists.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu9) dapper; urgency=low

  * Re-add xutils and xbase-clients metapackages.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu8) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add xserver-xorg-driver-sisusb to amd64, i386 and powerpc; add
    -driver-voodoo to amd64 and i386.

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu7) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add dh_install call to binary-arch instead of just being in -indep
    (thanks, Andres Salomon).

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 10:21:13 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Change xserver-xorg's dependency on x-common to x11-common.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 01:39:58 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu5) dapper; urgency=low

  * Also check that /usr/bin/X11 isn't a symlink, since -d covers both
    directories, and symlinks to directories.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 20 Jan 2006 00:00:58 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu4) dapper; urgency=low

  * Clean debian/local/X instead of debian/local/xserver-wrapper, and make
    x11-common Arch: any instead of all.  I am clever.  (closes: Malone#28967)

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 23:00:03 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Perform x-common-esque symlink<->dir transitions in x11-common; add
    Conflicts on x-common.
  * Trim default set of input drivers down to evdev, keyboard, mouse, wacom.
  * Rejig handling of x-window-system-core depends.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 17:06:53 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add laptop-detect dependency to x11-common, make preinst slightly more,
    er, robust, in the face of failure (closes: Malone#28911).
  * Add dependencies in laptop-detect, xresprobe, mdetect and discover1 to
    xserver-xorg.

 -- Daniel Stone <daniel.stone@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 19 Jan 2006 08:33:23 +1100

xorg (7.0.0-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * This package now only provides metapackages; we're now modular for real
    real, not for play play.
  * The xlibs, xlibs-data, xlibs-static-dev, xlibs-static-pic, xbase-clients,
    xutils, and x-window-system-dev packages have been removed.  xlibs-dev
    remains.  For now.
  * Merge xserver-common and xorg-common packages into x11-common.
  * Rewrite keyboard detection list to work off d-i keymap only, not language
    too.
  * Drop support for upgrades from pre-sarge, remove support for
    XORG_FORCE_PROBE environment variable.  Remove support for
    non-multiplexed mice in dexconf.
  * Prune unneeded bits of shell-lib.sh (which turns out to be most of it).
  * Move xserver-xorg.config.in detection bits into .postinst.in, so it all
    happens in the one place, and we can use the X server to configure itself
    by detecting its own driver if need be.
  * Move all previous changelog entries to changelog.Debian.old.
  * neomagic is also special, in terms of mode validation on laptops
    (closes: Ubuntu#18957).
  * Move update-linux-hardened-support call from xserver-xorg postinst to
    xserver-xorg-core.
  * Move md5sum/roster directory to /var/lib/x11 from /var/lib/xfree86, and
    use /usr/bin/Xorg, instead of /usr/bin/X11/Xorg.
  * I don't think the following:
     Users of SGI Indigo2 XL machines, or machines with other buses not yet
     fully supported, should specify simply "1" here.  (This is not
     guaranteed to work.)
     was really necessary to have in a Debconf note, so let's remove it.
  * Get rid of write_dri_section question, and just always write it.
  * Replace $NOPROBE with $AUTODETECT_VIDEO, and $DOPROBE with $UPGRADE,
    inverting the senses of both variables.
  * Remove support for DEBUG_XFREE86_* variables (has been DEBUG_XORG_* for a
    while now).
  * Remove compatibility code for xresprobe < 0.4.13.
  * Remove long-unused 'are you on an LCD?' question.
  * Don't touch the config file when we're upgrading.  Specific migrations
    needed can be done in-place.
  * Add seconds to the backup xorg.conf file's name, so you can do multiple
    reconfigures in the same minute.
  * Remove language -> keymap 'smarts'.
  * Make xserver-xorg depend on either the full set of drivers
    (xserver-xorg-driver-all, xserver-xorg-input-all), or any individual
    driver (xserver-xorg-driver, xserver-xorg-input).
  * Remove all dependencies on -driver-atimisc, as it is part of -ati.
  * Nuke irrelevant history section and segue into xf86cfg description from
    dexconf's manpage, update XF86Config-4 references to talk about xorg.conf
    instead.
  * Remove code which checked if a given directory didn't exist ... right
    after it ensured it had been created.
  * Change default mouse protocol to ExplorerPS/2 (closes: Ubuntu#4106).
  * Remove support in dexconf for CID fonts, since mkcfm is wildly non-free.
  * Remove support for ZAxisMapping.
  * Ensure GLcore is removed from the module list when upgrading.
  * Remove XFree86 history spiel from x11-common description.
  * Add /usr/X11R6/bin/X -> /usr/bin/X link.
  * Ask the 'which server?' question at priority low.
  * Remove hppa's hardcoded null _INPUT_DEPENDS, as the libdl-based loader has
    dragged the rest of this architecture kicking and screaming into 1983.
    Unfortunately LaMont is still stuck in 1975, but you can't expect me to
    fix that.
